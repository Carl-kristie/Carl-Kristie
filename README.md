### Hi, I'm Carlkristie
I'm currently a Front-end developer with focus on React Js and TypeScript.
I started my self taught coding journey about 4 years ago when i got into HTML and CSS because i was told it was the easiest way to get into software developmentðŸ˜….... been a fun ride I've absolutely loved and enjoyed because i learnt to build different things with Javascript and even made a bit of money from it freelancing.
I'm currently looking to go into this fulltime so I'm currently on the look out for a front-end role ideally writing React Js. Let's Chat if you're hiring.
